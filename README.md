# Overview

**This is a GAS project library for Google Apps Script (GAS). This library can be used for the projects of both standalone script type and container-bound script type.**

<a name="description"></a>

# Description

There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is such Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created [ProjectApp](https://github.com/tanaikech/ProjectApp). On the other hand, as a CLI tool for operating GAS project, there has already been [ggsrun](https://github.com/tanaikech/ggsrun).

Recently, by more update of Google, [Google Apps Script API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest/) was updated. By this, users got to be able to be more easily to manage the GAS projects. This was also reflected to this library. So I created ProjectApp2.

## Features

1. **Retrieve scripts in a project as Blob and JSON.**

1. **Create a project from Blob and JSON.**

1. **Update a project from Blob and JSON.**

For Blob, you can create new project from a file or several files on Google Drive. ProjectApp2 can use both [standalone script type](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/standalone) and [container-bound script type](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/bound) by updating [Google Apps Script API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest/).

### How to enable APIs directly

If you know project ID of the script that you use, you can directly access to the page to enable API using your browser.

- For Drive API
  - `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/?project=### project ID ###`
- For Apps Script API
  - `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/script.googleapis.com/?project=### project ID ###`

### About scopes

ProjectApp2 uses 2 scopes.

1. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request`
1. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects`

These are provided from ProjectApp2 by Manifests. So users are not required to install these scopes.

| getProjectInfo(projectId)                        | Object   | Retrieve project information using project ID. The detail is [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest/v1/projects#Project).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| getProjectBlob(projectId, zip)                   | Blob[]   | Retrieve scripts from a project as Blob[]. **Each blob means each script in a project.** Scripts are returned as an array like `[blob, blob, blob, ...]`. The blob can be seen using [`getDataAsString()`](<https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/blob#getDataAsString()>) and [`DriveApp.createFile(blob)`](<https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/drive-app#createFile(BlobSource)>). `zip` is a boolean. If `zip` is true, scripts are returned as blob of a zip file. |
| createProjectByBlob(projectname, blob, folderId) | Object   | Create a project from Blob[]. **Each blob means each script in a project.** So if you have a script which is a file of sample.gs, you can use as a blob using `DriveApp.getFileById("### file id of sample.gs ###").getBlob()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| updateProjectByBlob(projectId, blob)             | Object   | Update existing project using Blob[]. **Each blob means each script in a project.** So if you have a script which is a file of sample.gs, you can use as a blob using `DriveApp.getFileById("### file id of sample.gs ###").getBlob()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| getProjectRaw(projectId)                         | Object[] | Retrieve scripts from a project as Object[]. The structure of Object[] is [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/import-export#export_projects_from_drive).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| createProjectByRaw(projectname, raw, parentId)   | Object   | Create a project from Object[]. The structure of Object[] is [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/import-export#export_projects_from_drive) `parentId` is the file ID of the Google Docs file. For example, when you want to create new container-bound script to Google Spreadsheet, please use the Spreadsheet ID as `parentId`.                                                                                                                                                            |
| updateProjectByRaw(projectId, raw)               | Object   | Update existing project using Object[]. The structure of Object[] is [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/import-export#export_projects_from_drive). **In this method, all scripts in a project is overwritten by raw data (JSON).**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You can also see the documents of library at the following URL.

[https://script.google.com/macros/library/versions/d/11qqgrTfCEydqwIF8RRrSZOrdq-KNsIDnUpnYefX5KobaMMArVSlXUqwS](https://script.google.com/macros/library/versions/d/11qqgrTfCEydqwIF8RRrSZOrdq-KNsIDnUpnYefX5KobaMMArVSlXUqwS)

## Samples

When you retrieve project information of a project, you can use scripts like below.

```javascript
var projectId = "#####";
var res = ProjectApp2.getProjectInfo(projectId);
Logger.log(res);
```

### Update existing project by blob

```javascript
var projectId = "#####";
var script1 = DriveApp.getFileById("### file id of sample.gs ###").getBlob();
var script2 = DriveApp.getFileById("### file id of sample.html ###").getBlob();
var blob = [script1, script2];
var res = ProjectApp2.updateProjectByBlob(projectId, blob);
Logger.log(res);
```

**If there is the same filename with the uploading script in the project, only the script is overwritten. Other scripts is not modified.**

### Create new project with special Manifests

```javascript
var json = {
  timeZone: "Asia/Tokyo",
  dependencies: {
    enabledAdvancedServices: [
      {
        userSymbol: "Drive",
        serviceId: "drive",
        version: "v2",
      },
    ],
  },
  exceptionLogging: "STACKDRIVER",
  oauthScopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"],
};
var blob = Utilities.newBlob(JSON.stringify(json, null, "\t")).setName(
  "appsscript.json"
);
var blob = [blob];
var res = ProjectApp2.createProjectByBlob(
  "### Project name ###",
  blob,
  "### parent ID ###"
);
// var res = ProjectApp2.updateProjectByBlob(projectId, blob); // If this is used, the Manifests in the existing project is updated.
Logger.log(res);
```

I think that a new installer can be created by using this.

- `parentId` is the file ID of the Google Docs file. For example, when you want to create new container-bound script to Google Spreadsheet, please use the Spreadsheet ID as `parentId`.

### Create new container-bound script to new Google Spreadsheet including a script.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  const sampleScript = 'function myfunction() {console.log("ok")}';
  const blob = Utilities.newBlob(sampleScript).setName("Code.gs");
  const spreadsheetId = SpreadsheetApp.create("sampleSpreadsheet").getId();
  const res = ProjectApp2.createProjectByBlob(
    "sampleProject",
    [blob],
    spreadsheetId
  );
  console.log(res);
}
```

By this, you can see new Google Spreadsheet of `sampleSpreadsheet` at the root folder of your Google Drive. When you open the Spreadsheet and open the script editor, you can see the sample script of `function myfunction() {console.log("ok")}`.
